"I just saw the post on permanent competitive bans and I am welcoming to it. If it weren't for the fact that we get disconnects that can potentially lead to permanent bans with no fault or bad behaviour of the player, it's just that they can't keep a stable connection. I would prefer if the system was able to distinguish between a disconnect and someone who has left on purpose. I do see where this can be violated with people just turning off their internet to cheat the system but with how well the reporting system has worked (nice job btw it's made the game what I think is the healthiest state yet). But there has to be a way to not get honest players who might not have the best internet to not get punished for playing the game, but still keep those unwanted players being punished for their unwelcome shenanigans.

            Hi Deepak,<br><br>OpenFOAM software is not designed for running with Window, but there are some versions available for windows ( which can at times be tedious ) .

"Hi Nathan,<br>1. Since icoFoam is a transient solver the solver will keeps running. You have to check the residual values. If it reaches say 10^-5 you can stop the iterations manually. The solver won't stop and report solution is converged unlike the steady state solver. Probably you can try use residual plot to have a clear view of the residues with number of iterations.<br>2. The kinematic viscosity has been fixed based on Reynold's number and not on thermodynamic property of the fluid. Re = (velocity*characteristic length)/(Kinematic viscosity). Re = 10. V= 1 m/s and d = 0.1 m. Which gives the kinematic viscosity to be 0.01.<br>3. Since we are calculating property based on Reynold's number the viscosity is independent of thermodynamic property of the fluid used.<br><br><br>Regards,<br>Sathish<br>",0
"Hi Nathan,<br>Regarding convergence I answered in your other question.<br>To do grid independence you try to create different meshes in salome and import it in OpenFoam and solve it. <br>Say you create different&nbsp; mesh sizes as you mentioned 40,80,160 in salome and solve it in OpenFoam. Try to plot the property say Velocity along length of pipe. Plot it for different mesh sizes in the same graph and ensure the property doesn't change with increase of grids. So that you can conclude the grid you have is finest optimum grid for that problem.<br>For the last part of question, it is advisable to maintain the geometry in meters.<br><br><br>",0
